## 📂 Project Directory Structure

The project has been separated into two dedicated directories:

* **[Frontend](file:///c:/Users/ADM/Downloads/project-zenithyuga/Frontend)**: The React + Vite client dashboard application.
* **[Backend](file:///c:/Users/ADM/Downloads/project-zenithyuga/Backend)**: The Node + Express backend server.

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Option A: Workspace Concurrent Runner (Recommended)
You can launch both Frontend and Backend concurrently from the root folder:

1. **Install dependencies** across the workspace, frontend, and backend folders:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```
2. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

* Frontend is accessible at: **`http://localhost:3000`**
* Backend is running on port: **`5000`**

### Option B: Run Directories Separately

#### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies & run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Backend
1. Navigate to the `Backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies & run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
